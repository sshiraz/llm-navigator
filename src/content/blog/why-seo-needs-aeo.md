# Why Your SEO Strategy Needs AEO

You've invested years into SEO. Your pages rank. Traffic flows. But there's a problem: **AI assistants are changing how people find information**, and your SEO strategy alone won't keep you visible.

## The Two Search Experiences

### Traditional Search (SEO Territory)

User searches → Google shows 10 blue links → User clicks → Traffic to your site

**What matters:** Keywords, backlinks, page speed, meta tags

### AI Search (AEO Territory)

User asks a question → AI generates one answer → User gets the answer directly

**What matters:** Being the source AI chooses to cite

## The Problem: SEO Success ≠ AI Visibility

Here's what we're seeing across hundreds of analyses:

| Scenario | Google Ranking | AI Citation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Site A | #1 for "best CRM software" | Not mentioned |
| Site B | #8 for "best CRM software" | Cited as top recommendation |

How is this possible? Because **AI doesn't use Google rankings to decide what to cite**.

AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity evaluate content differently:

- Does this source directly answer the question?
- Is the information structured and easy to extract?
- Does this source have authority signals?
- Is the content comprehensive and up-to-date?

## What SEO Gets Right (That AEO Also Needs)

Not everything changes. These SEO fundamentals still matter for AEO:

### 1. Quality Content

Both Google and AI reward well-researched, accurate content. No shortcuts here.

### 2. Site Authority

Backlinks and brand mentions signal trust to both search engines and AI systems.

### 3. Technical Foundation

Fast load times, mobile-friendly design, and proper HTML structure help both.

## What AEO Adds to the Equation

Here's where AEO diverges from traditional SEO:

### 1. Direct Answer Formatting

SEO content often buries the answer to maximize time on page. AEO content **leads with the answer**.

**SEO approach:**
> "When considering the best project management tools, there are many factors to evaluate. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore..."

**AEO approach:**
> "The best project management tools for startups are Asana, Monday.com, and Notion. Here's why each excels..."

### 2. Schema Markup for AI Understanding

While schema helps SEO, it's **critical for AEO**. AI systems rely heavily on structured data to understand:

- What type of content this is (Article, FAQ, Product, HowTo)
- Who created it (Organization, Person)
- What it's about (specific entities and topics)

### 3. Entity Clarity

AI needs to understand **what your brand is** and **what you're an authority on**.

- Do you have a clear entity statement on your site?
- Is your brand consistently described across the web?
- Do you claim your topic territory explicitly?

### 4. Conversational Query Optimization

SEO targets keywords: "best crm software 2026"

AEO targets questions: "What's the best CRM for a 10-person sales team?"

The content structure is fundamentally different.

## The Integration: SEO + AEO

You don't abandon SEO. You **layer AEO on top of it**.

### Your Updated Content Checklist

| Element | SEO | AEO | Both |
|---------|-----|-----|------|
| Keyword in title | ✓ | | |
| Direct answer in first paragraph | | ✓ | |
| Comprehensive coverage | | | ✓ |
| Schema markup | ✓ | ✓ | |
| FAQ section | | ✓ | |
| Internal links | ✓ | | |
| Entity statement | | ✓ | |
| Authoritative backlinks | | | ✓ |

### Priority Order for Existing Content

1. **Add schema markup** to your top-performing pages
2. **Restructure intros** to lead with answers
3. **Add FAQ sections** addressing common questions
4. **Create entity clarity** on your About page

## How to Measure AEO Success

SEO has clear metrics: rankings, traffic, click-through rate.

AEO metrics are different:

- **Citation rate** — How often AI mentions your brand
- **Citation context** — Are you mentioned positively or just listed?
- **Competitor citations** — Who's getting cited instead of you?
- **Query coverage** — Which questions trigger your citation?

## The Bottom Line

SEO and AEO aren't competitors — they're **layers of the same visibility strategy**.

- SEO ensures you're findable when people search traditionally
- AEO ensures you're cited when people ask AI

Ignore either one, and you're leaving visibility on the table.
