# What is Answer Engine Optimization?

Traditional SEO focuses on ranking in search results. **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** focuses on being cited in AI-generated answers.

## The Shift from Links to Answers

When someone searches on Google, they see a list of blue links. They click through to websites, and traffic flows.

But when someone asks ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity a question, something fundamentally different happens:

- The AI **generates an answer** directly
- It may cite sources, but users often don't click through
- Your brand either appears in that answer, or it doesn't exist

## Why Traditional SEO Isn't Enough

You can rank #1 on Google for "best project management software" and still be completely invisible in AI answers.

Here's why:

1. **AI doesn't rank pages** — it synthesizes information
2. **AI has its own criteria** for what content to cite
3. **AI favors structured, authoritative content** over keyword-optimized pages

## What AEO Focuses On

Answer Engine Optimization involves:

- **Content structure** that AI can easily parse (headings, lists, clear definitions)
- **Schema markup** that helps AI understand your content type
- **Authority signals** that make AI trust your content
- **Direct answers** to common questions in your niche

## How to Get Started

1. **Audit your AI visibility** — Check if you're being cited by major AI assistants
2. **Analyze competitors** — See who is getting cited instead of you
3. **Optimize content structure** — Make it easy for AI to extract information
4. **Build topical authority** — Become the go-to source in your niche
