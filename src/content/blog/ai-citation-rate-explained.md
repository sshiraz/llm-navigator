# What is AI Citation Rate?

**Citation rate** measures how often AI assistants reference your content when answering questions in your industry.

If you ask 10 questions about project management software and your brand appears in 3 answers, your citation rate is 30%.

## Why Citation Rate Matters

Citation rate is the new visibility metric for the AI era:

- **Higher citation rate** = More exposure to potential customers
- **Zero citation rate** = You're invisible in AI search
- **Competitor citation rate** = Who's winning the AI visibility race

## How We Calculate It

LLM Navigator calculates citation rate by:

1. Querying multiple AI providers (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini)
2. Using industry-relevant prompts
3. Checking if your brand/domain is mentioned
4. Calculating: `(Cited Results / Total Queries) × 100`

## What's a Good Citation Rate?

| Citation Rate | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| 0-10% | Low visibility — needs significant work |
| 10-30% | Moderate — room for improvement |
| 30-50% | Good — competitive position |
| 50%+ | Excellent — industry leader status |
